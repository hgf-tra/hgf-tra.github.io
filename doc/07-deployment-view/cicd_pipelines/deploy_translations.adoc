= Deployment Translations

This pipeline deploys the dump of the translation data that
was taken from the staging host group during the
link:build_hts.adoc[build process of HTS].
Translations are deployed to hostgroups not
equal to Staging!

== Artifacts

- hts_localization.sql +
will be deployed to the 'database host'. +
*Localization data is always extracted from the staging* platform,
which is the only one, where any adjustments to the translations
are maintained.

The deployment of the translations is triggered by
the link:deploy_hts.adoc[HTS deployment pipeline],
if you select to deploy this artifact.
